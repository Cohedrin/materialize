# Materialize Performance Handbook

This directory contains the build scripts and markdown source necessary to
build the Materialize Performance Handbook.

## Developing the Handbook

To start a preview server locally, in develop mode, run the following command:

    $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/performance/handbook/bin/develop

The handbook should have the rest of the info you need. :grin:
