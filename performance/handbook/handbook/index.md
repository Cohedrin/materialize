# Materialize Performance Handbook for Developers

Welcome to the Materialize Performance Handbook! This handbook contains the knowledge necessary to
get started with measuring, evaluating and improving the performance of Materialized.

!!! caution "Contents May Be Slightly Out-of-Date"

    This handbook is not yet deployed continuously from our CI system. Instead, it is deployed
    manually and therefore may not contain the most recent information.

## Improving This Guide

This entire guide is built from source in the [MaterializeInc/materialize][] repository and is
considered a living document. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that this handbook is
relevant and up to date. Please open an issue if anything is confusing, doesn't work as expected
or is no longer necessary.

!!! tip "Edit Directly on GitHub!"

    Have an improvement that you'd like to suggest? There's a pencil icon in the upper right
    corner.  Click the pencil, make your edits and open a PR! Works best for small edits.

### Preview Changes Locally

While the GitHub edit button can be useful for smaller edits, running the Handbook locally in
developer mode works much better for larger changes. To see the rendered result of your changes on
your local machine, head on over to [how to build the handbook locally guide](guides/building.md).

!!! attention "Remember -- This Guide is a Work in Progress"

    instructions under the [Building the Handbook Guide](guides/building.md).
